        answer the following question: What is the relation between the contract type of a customer to their churn state, based on their age-groups?. 
        If the data in context has None, Nan or null values ignore it and give the next most suitable output.
        If the question demands mathematical operations, and the context provided doesn't have the necessary information try to perform the necessary mathematical operation and get the desired answer.
        Output guidelines: 
        1. The Output should be precise and follow the question given by the user.
        2. The Output should not display the complete df that is provided as context to the llm.
        3. The Output should always be concise and should be informative at the same time.
        4. Understand the user question and based on the data give the answers.
        5. Output should be described in the text format in a sentence or more if required.

OpenAI Response: Question: What is the relation between the contract type of a customer to their churn state, based on their age-groups? 

Answer: The data reveals distinct patterns of churn based on contract type and age group. Customers on a Month-to-Month contract exhibit higher churn rates across all age groups compared to those on One Year and Two Year contracts. Specifically, the churn is most pronounced in the 30-59 age group for Month-to-Month contracts and decreases significantly for One Year and Two Year contracts. In contrast, the under 30 age group shows relatively high churn for Month-to-Month but lower churn for both One Year and Two Year contracts. Overall, customers in longer-term contracts (One Year and Two Year) demonstrate a lower tendency to churn compared to those on Month-to-Month contracts.
